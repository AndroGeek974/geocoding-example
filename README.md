# geocoding-example

Examples of how to use the Mapbox geocoder. We do our best to make our [geocoding API simple to understand](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/geocoding/). But sometimes it's nice to see example implementations of things like parallelized batch geocoding.

This repo is a work in progress. Don't see your favorite language? [Open a ticket](https://github.com/mapbox/geocoding-example/issues/new)!

Please consult individual subdirectories' README files for more specific installation instructions and notes.

## Note

Permanent and batch geocoding is currently only available for enterprise plans. Please email sales@mapbox.com if you're interested in testing this functionality.
